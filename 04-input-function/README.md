## input()

It asks the user for an input.

by default, the type of input is a string.

```py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello",name)
```

If the user does not provide an input, the rest of the code will not get executed.

#### Summation with users input

```py
# We have to do the type casting here
x = int(input("Enter x: "))
y = int(input("Enter y: "))
print("sum =",x+y)
```

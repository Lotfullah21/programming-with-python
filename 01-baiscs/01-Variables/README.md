## Variables

variables are placeholders for the memory address of our application, In fact, we are not saving the values to the variables but rather, their memory address in our computer.

The moment the variable is created, a memory location for the values its assigned also will be created, to store a value, we use `=` operator,

```py
a = 20
```

Once, the variable is assigned a value, we can use it as many times as we want,

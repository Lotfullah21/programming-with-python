### How Functions Work in Python:

- Definition: we define a function with the `def` keyword.
- Execution: a function doesn't run until you call it. When you call it,
  - allocates memory for the local variables defined inside the function.
  - passes the arguments to the function parameters.
  - executes the function's code.
  - if thereâ€™s a return statement, it sends back a value; otherwise, it returns None.

`Scope`: Variables declared inside the function are local and temporary, meaning they only exist during the function's execution.

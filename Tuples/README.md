<h1>Tuples</h1>
tuples are ordered sequence of elements, by ordered we mean, it can be indexed, or we can get the element in the sequence by specific indexing

1. they are immutables,which means once 2. values assigned cannot be changed later.

2. tuple values lives inside parenthesis ()

3. tuples can have different kind of values

4. adding two tuples is possible, but it does not mean adding their values, rather they will be putted side by side, we can call this concatenation.

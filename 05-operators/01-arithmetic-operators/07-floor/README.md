Floor division : In Python, // is used to conduct the floor division. It is used to find the floor of the quotient when first operand is divided by the second.
For instance, if the result of a/b = 1.9, the output of a//b would 1.
In general, when we talk about floor operation, it ignores the terms after decimal point.

```py
math.floor(1.232) = 1
math.floor(1.9) = 1
```

For negative numbers, it gives one number below the given number.

```py
math.floor(-3.1) # -4
math.floor(-35.9) # -36
```

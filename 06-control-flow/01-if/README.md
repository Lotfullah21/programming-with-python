## `if` Statement in Python

The `if` statement is a fundamental control flow structure in Python that allows you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a specific condition is `True` or `False`. It enables decision-making in a program.

### Syntax of `if` Statement

```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if condition is True

```

```py
a = 10
if a>1:
    print(f"{a} is greater than 1")
```

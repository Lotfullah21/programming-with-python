## Dictionaries

A dictionary is a collection of items which have the following properties

- collection of key-value pairs
- unordered
- all keys must be distinct
- values maybe repeated
- uses hashing internally
- mutable

```PY
VAR_NAME = {KEY:VALUE}
VAR_NAME = {KEY1:VALUE1, KEY2:VALUE2}
```

```py
capitals = {"Afghanistan":"Kabul","India":"New Delhi"}
```

dictionaries are one of the most common used data structure which have many real world applications.
For instance, creating a dictionary of words, where the key is the word and its value is the meaning of that word.
Another usage of dictionaries would be storing frequency of a value, for instance counting number of votes for a candidate.

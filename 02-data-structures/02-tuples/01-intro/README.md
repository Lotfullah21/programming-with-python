Tuples also can be created with separated commas in between.
For instance, `10, 12, 129` is a tuple, also `10,` is a tuple.

Tuples are faster than lists.
We use them in scenarios where the values are not going to changes or there is a fixed range of values.
For instance,

- Days of the week
- Gender
- Admin roles

Most of the list operation is supported by tuples, like indexing, count, len and index.
Functionalities that modify the lists are not available, like sort, reverse and clear.

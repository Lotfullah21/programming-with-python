## slicing

```py
s[start:stop:step]
```

Where:

start is the index where the slice begins (inclusive).
stop is the index where the slice ends (exclusive).
step is the amount by which the index increases or decreases.
If any of these parameters are omitted, they default to:

start: Beginning of the string.
stop: End of the string.
step: 1 (move one index at a time).

## Type Conversion

Many times, we need to convert our data from one type other type, for instance, we have floats and we want to convert them to integers, or we have tuples and we want to convert them to list.

Mainly, there is two kind of type conversion that takes place,

#### 1. Implicit Conversion

Implicit conversion happens automatically when Python handles different data types during an operation. Python implicitly converts one data type to another without the programmer's intervention to avoid data loss or errors.

#### 2. Explicit Conversion

Explicit conversion, also known as type casting, is when the programmer manually converts one data type to another using built-in functions. This type of conversion is done when you need a specific data type in certain scenarios.
